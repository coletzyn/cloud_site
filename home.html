            <h2>Cole : An Aspiring Cybersecurity Researcher</h2>
            <p>Since middle school I've been a hacker. I started using CheatEngine on Roblox games which quickly graduated to pentesting Windows 7 boxes. My security shenanigans were just a hobby for a long time; it wasn't until after college that I learned that cybersecurity existed outside of the realm of the NSA.</p>
            <p>I brushed cybersecurity aside, thinking that without a degree I would have no shot at becoming a 'professional hacker'. </p>
            <p>After spending a year in marketing analytics, I was laid off by my company. I spent my time thinking about what I really wanted to do. It took a while, but, I finally realized I was meant to work in IT.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2023 I got a job at Charter Communications as a Chat Repair Agent. I learned basic troubleshooting of internet services, how ISPs work from a bird's eye view and began studying for my CCNA.</p>
            <p>In September of 2023 I decided to move down to Texas and I got my current job as an IT Assistant where I create networks, manage user access control and install and configure next generation firewalls. Currently I'm pushing for the creation of a cybersecurity program for one of my company's clients.</p>
            <p>So, feel free to follow along for what comes next...</p>

            <h2>My Latest Project</h2>
            <p>My most recent project is actually this website. I realized the best way to showcase my skills was by creating a platform where I can host my personal projects.</p>
            <p>This website was hand coded from the ground up with HTML, CSS and Javascript with NodeJS for the backend. It was deployed to a Microsoft Azure Linux VM with Terraform.</p>
            <p>Along the way I learned the ins and outs of cloud deployment and refreshed my javascript skills. All of the code for this site can be found on my github.</p>

            <h2>My Next Adventure</h2>
            <p>An area of cybersecurity that I've always found interesting was malware development. I am especially interested in malware development because it merges two things that I find very interesting: software development and cybersecurity. To state the obvious, this project is purely for educational purposes and will be deployed on a virtual network. I do not endorse the use of malware for anything other than education.</p>
            <p>No, I will not give you the code when I'm done.</p>
